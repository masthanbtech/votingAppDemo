Assignment-4: Voting App 

My observations: 
cluster information. 
  [root@ip-172-31-14-14 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get all
  NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  pod/db-b54cd94f4-xhwnw        1/1     Running   0          24h
  pod/redis-868d64d78-kqml8     1/1     Running   0          24h

After deleting voting Pod: 
	replicas will create new voting pod and its pod name changes from "vote-94849dc97-6sssz" to "vote-94849dc97-7kmv6". 
	Application is working fine.  

After deleting worker pod:
	replicas will create new worker pod and old worker node (worker-dd46d7584-s87hz) went to terminating state and deleted from the list after few seconds. 
  A New worker node container is created with worker-dd46d7584-9cwdj). Application is working fine. 

After deleting db pod: 
	eplicas will create new db pod and old db node(db-b54cd94f4-xhwnw) went to terminating state. A new db node container is created with db-b54cd94f4-5xct6. 
	Now if we update our vote then results are not reflecting in result application. Result pod will use socket Id to connect with dB pod to get a information and 
	socket id is binding with old dB pod so there is no communication even though we update new votes. 
Steps to work result Pod: 
	We can delete result pod and re-creates then application is working fine again.
